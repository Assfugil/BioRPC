# BioRPC
An RPC for dsc.bio, made in Node.

## Warning
Fair warning, this __SHOULD NOT__ be used on any OS besides Windows, ***NOR*** should it be run with vanilla Node. BioRPC was designed to be used on Win32 and in a _binary built with pkg_. If you know how to make this multi-platformed and make BioRPC support plain Node instead of a Node pkg binary, please make a PR with the changes! Thank you!
